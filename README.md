# CrapsStrategy


As a degenerate gambler and "software" "engineer", I set out to create a simple program to emulate a betting strategy for the game of Craps -- the only good gambling venture that is not poker or your life. 

To run this program just run: python gui.py on a command line

Future additions:
  * Take statistics of many games to determine efficacy of one strategy over another (it's gambling, it doesn't matter)
  * Improve betting stratigies (ML??????) and create a modularized "plug and play" strategy system
  * Better graphics (bells and whistles to keep the degenerate's dopamine level from falling below critical levels)
